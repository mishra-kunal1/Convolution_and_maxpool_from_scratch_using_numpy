# Convolution_and_maxpool_from_scratch_using_numpy

Convolution is an operation commonly used in machine learning that involves "sliding" a small filter (a matrix of numbers) over a larger input matrix and computing a dot product between the two matrices at each position. This process creates a new output matrix that summarizes how the input matrix features match the filter pattern.

Let's understand the Convolution operation on 2d images through this example

Now let's write code for it and check the output

```python
import numpy as np
import conv_step

def convolution_operation_2D_Image(input_image, kernel, stride, pad):
    """
    Performs a 2D convolution operation on a given input_image with a given kernel.

    Args:
    input_image (numpy array): a 2D array representing the input image
    kernel (numpy array): a 2D array representing the weights used for the convolution
    stride (int): the stride used for the convolution operation
    pad (int): the amount of zero padding to be added to the input image

    Returns:
    final_output (numpy array): a 2D array representing the result of the convolution operation
    """
    
    # Get the height and width of the input image and kernel
    input_height, input_width = input_image.shape
    kernel_height, kernel_width = kernel.shape
    
    # Add zero padding to the input image based on the given pad value
    padded_image = np.pad(input_image, pad, 'constant', constant_values=(0, 0))
    
    # Calculate the output height and width based on the input size, kernel size, stride, and pad
    output_height = int((input_height - kernel_height + 2 * pad) / stride) + 1
    output_width = int((input_width - kernel_width + 2 * pad) / stride) + 1
    
    # Create an empty array for the final output
    final_output = np.zeros((output_height, output_width))
    
    # Loop through each element of the final output array
    for h in range(output_height):
        h_start = h * stride
        h_end = h_start + kernel_height
        
        for w in range(output_width):
            w_start = w * stride
            w_end = w_start + kernel_width
            
            # Get the image patch corresponding to the current output element
            image_patch = padded_image[h_start:h_end, w_start:w_end]
            
            # Perform a convolution step on the image patch and the kernel
            final_output[h, w] = conv_step(image_patch, kernel)
    
    # Return the final output array
    return final_output

```

If we call our function and perform the convolution overation on the above image we get the following ouput

### Voila, 2d Convolutions are working

## Convolution operation on RGB Images and using a single filter - Input shape =height x width x num_channels

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99056351/219204102-a086ab29-df83-4f0e-9eff-6da7671995ce.png)

The input layer and the filter have the same depth (channel number = kernel number). The 3D filter moves only in 2-direction, height & width of the image (Thatâ€™s why such operation is called as 2D convolution although a 3D filter is used to process 3D volumetric data). At each sliding position, we perform element-wise multiplication and addition, which results in a single number. In the example shown below, the sliding is performed at 5 positions horizontally and 5 positions vertically. Overall, we get a single output channel.
The code convolution operation for a single image using a single kernel is in convolution_operation_3d(RGB)_image.py

## Convolution operation in batch of RGB images using multiple filters

While writing code in Tensorflow or Pytorch we perform the convolution operations on a batch of images. The input given is is the form batch_size x height_image x width_image x num_channels whereas the kernerl_input is given in the form num_filters x filter_size X filter_size x filter_channels.

The output we get after these operations is (batch_size x output_height x output_width x filter_channels)

We always perform 2D convolution operation on a batch of 3D input images with a given kernel.
The code for Convolution operation in batch of RGB images using multiple filters is in convolution_operation_batch_of_3d_images.py 

Following code compare the output  after applying Tensorflow's Convolution 2D layers and Custom function for a batch of input images.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D
import numpy as np

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(1)

# Generate random data
## 4 random RGB images of size 9x9x3
input_image_batch = np.random.randn(4, 9, 9, 3).astype(np.float32)
kernel = np.random.randn(8, 5, 5, 3).astype(np.float32)

# Apply custom convolution operation to input images
output_custom = convolution_operation_batch_3D_images(input_image_batch, kernel, stride=1, pad=2)
print('Output shape of custom convolution')
print(output_custom.shape)

# Apply TensorFlow's Conv2D layer to input images
init = tf.constant_initializer(kernel.transpose(1, 2, 3, 0))
conv_layer = Conv2D(filters=8, kernel_size=5, strides=1, padding='same', use_bias=False, kernel_initializer=init)
output_tensorflow = conv_layer(tf.constant(input_image_batch))
output_tensorflow = output_tensorflow.numpy()
print('Output shape of TensorFlow convolution')
print(output_tensorflow.shape)

# Compare outputs of custom and TensorFlow's convolution
print('*' * 50)
assert np.allclose(np.round(output_tensorflow, 2), np.round(output_custom, 2), rtol=1e-5, atol=1e-8)
print("Outputs of both methods are the same")
print('*' * 50)


```
Here's the output we get after running the code
